# dwn

<!-- cargo-rdme start -->

Rust implementation of a [Decentralized Web Node](https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/).

The DWN spec is a work-in-progress and often out of date from other implementations,
so it is treated more as a loose guide rather than an absolute set of rules to follow.
